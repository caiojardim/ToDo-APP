This is a ToDo List aplication created with React, using Vite to create the aplication.

Was used a figma layout presented in the Rocketseat Ignite course.

This project was used to apply some comcepts learned in the first project of the course.

- Components
- Proprierties
- States
- Objects Iteration in React ...

Observations:

- I decide to use localStorage in my application that was not request in the challenge.
  I used to store the task List data so if the user close the application, he will still have the information save in his browser.

Thigs that I learned with this aplication:

- I learned how to use checkbox properly, styling in the way that i want, hiding the input and using a span to style.
- I learned how to deal with some typing problems that I passed in TypeScript.
